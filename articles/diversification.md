# Diversification of institutional funds has gone too far (Under construction)

PFZW is a dutch pension fund with about 237 billion euros under management. As of 31 juli 2024, they had at least 450 (in)direct holdings in publicly traded stocks worth less than 200.000 euro. 
In this piece I will argue that large pension funds, managing the retirements of working class people, should be less diversified and obtain larger ownership percentages of companies. This will result in more influence over the companies' policies and these pension funds should use this power to improve the conditions of the working class.
